# Project

This assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/binary-search-trees) is to build a balanced binary search tree using Ruby. A binary search tree is balanced when the height difference between the left and right subtrees is no greater than 1. This project uses both depth-first and breadth-first traversal algorithms.

This program creates a random set of numbers to build a balanced tree, checks for balance and rebalances an unbalanced tree. Nodes can be inserted or deleted. The nodes are printed in level, pre, post, and in order methods.

Shout out to @Fensus from The Odin Project for sharing the elegant #pretty_print method in the lesson!
